ðŸ¤– Simple Chatbot: Command-Line Conversation

This project is a minimalistic **command-line chatbot** implemented in Python, capable of handling basic greetings and responses. The chatbot interacts with users in real time, recognizing a few predefined phrases and gracefully ending the conversation when prompted.

It demonstrates the fundamentals of creating an interactive text-based application in Python and provides a foundation to build more advanced conversational agents.
